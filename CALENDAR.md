## AllClo

This non-recurring session is for finalizing a first draft of AllClo.  
It is tentatively planned for no later than 2022-02-20.

For further reference, see https://github.com/friendzymes/community/issues/15.

## Bsub

This session is for organizing and discussing engineering of *Bacillus subtilis* for frugal protein manufacturing.

## Interlab

The interlab session is a generalist, get-stuff-done session meant as a standard time set aside to ensure that there's a time consistently understood as guarded for *coworking* rather than meetings-proper. That is, this is a consistently available block of time for synchronous coworking on priority tasks like:

- friendzymes grant/proposal writing
- friendzymes labwork, especially that involving coordination between multiple labs
- friendzymes research & development generally — excluding software, which is anticipated to receive its own session.

Additionally, this session is meant to provide ongoing availability for 'hosted' sessions, with the goal of reduced organizing overhead for anyone who would like to run a workshop / jam session / practice talk / etc. on an ad hoc basis. Please just let us know in this channel, #interlab, or let me know via DM, when you would like to use this session for something in particular so we can announce it.

At its start, this session will be tentatively scheduled to run every other week on Tuesday evenings US, eastern timezone. The work session ends at the scheduled start of the Friendzymes Asia/Pacific meet *aka* Biweekly Meeting B, which currently focuses on labwork at PGC Mindanao.

## Yeast

This channel will be the focal point for all things yeast with Friendzymes!

### Tentative Topics

These topics are by informal suggestion of weekly meeting attendees.  
They have chat channels but may not materialize as routine sessions.
